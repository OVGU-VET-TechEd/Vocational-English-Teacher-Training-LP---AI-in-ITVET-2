<br>

Core Pedagogical Principle

> **AI supports learning – it does not replace teaching.**

### Activity 3: AI Use vs Non-Use Comparison

Compare two lesson versions:

* Traditional vocational English activity
* AI-enhanced version

<br>

**Identify:**

1. What **problem AI solves**
2. What **remains human-led**
3. What **must not be automated**
<br>

| Customer dialogue | Role-play simulation | Pragmatics, cultural appropriateness |
<br>

### Activity 4: Differentiation with AI

**Practice:**

* Adjusting AI output for **different CEFR levels**
* Using AI to generate **simplified vs technical explanations**
* Designing **choice-based tasks** using AI support

What kind of teacher strategy can be designed for this? Let's discuss together this time

    [( )] Assessment
    [( )] Alignment
    [( )] Media-usage
    [(X)] Intervention



##  Accessibility & Inclusion Planning

<div style="text-align:center">

* Important! 

<br>

This is not the assessment segment of our workshop, but a teaching phase where teachers are trained for AI usage on student evaluation.

> **Focus:** Process-Oriented, Transparent, Ethical Assessment (60 minutes)

Learning Outcomes

Teachers will be able to:

- [x] Assess **learning processes**, not just outputs
- [x] Define clear AI authorship rules
- [x] Collect feedback on AI effectiveness and bias

<br>

<br>

### Assessment Design Workshop

<br>

**Recommended Assessment Components:**

1. Draft + revision comparison
2. Prompt explanation
3. Oral defence / reflection
4. AI-use declaration statement

<br>

Sample AI Attribution Statement

**Student-Facing:**

```
"AI tools were used to generate an initial draft.
All revisions, corrections, and final decisions were made by me."
```

<br>

<br>

Feedback Loop Design

**Create:**

* Student feedback form on AI usefulness
* Bias/error reporting mechanism
* Teacher reflection log for tool review

## Final Outputs for Teachers

By the end of the training, teachers will have:

- [x] A vetted AI tool shortlist
- [x] A compliant AI-use checklist
- [x] A ready-to-teach AI-enhanced Vocational English lesson
- [x] Ethical & assessment guidelines
- [x] Confidence to justify AI use to stakeholders

<br>

<br>

## Resources & Next Steps

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Review institutional AI policies
2. Pilot one AI-enhanced lesson
3. Join teacher peer-learning community
4. Schedule follow-up reflection session

> **Remember:** The goal is not to become AI experts, but to become better teachers with AI as a supportive tool.
