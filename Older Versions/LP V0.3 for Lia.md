| TVET Pedagogy | Authentic workplace language tasks |
| Internationalization | Industry communication, intercultural awareness |

### Learning Outcomes (Bloom's Taxonomy)

By the end of this lesson, teachers will be able to:

| Bloom's Level | Learning Outcome |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Remember** | Identify key ethical principles and risks related to AI use in teacher professional development |
| **Understand** | Explain how AI can support (not replace) teacher reflection, coaching, and decision-making |
| **Apply** | Use generative AI tools for self-assessment, lesson reflection, and professional goal-setting |
| **Analyze** | Evaluate AI feedback critically, identifying bias, limitations, and contextual mismatches |
| **Evaluate** | Judge ethical dilemmas involving AI (privacy, autonomy, over-automation) in vocational English contexts |
| **Create** | Design a personalized AI-assisted professional development workflow for their own teaching practice |

## Session Structure Overview

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| Phase 1 | Compliance & Trustworthiness | 60 min |
| Phase 2 | Pedagogical AI Integration | 90 min |
| Phase 3 | Vocational Application Design | 90 min |
| Phase 4 | Ethics & Human-Centricity | 60 min |
| Phase 5 | Assessment & Feedback | 60 min |

## Phase 1: Pre-Planning & Tool Selection

Learning Outcomes

Teachers will be able to:

- [x] Select **non-high-risk AI tools** appropriate for Vocational English
- [x] Identify **GDPR-safe classroom practices**
- [x] Conduct a **basic AI risk and bias check** before classroom use

<br>

<br>

Key AI Tools

**Examples (adaptable by institution):**

* AI writing assistant (non-account-based / anonymized)
* AI chatbot for role-play simulations
* AI grammar / clarity checker
* AI translation tool (for contrastive analysis, not replacement)

> **Important:** Tools used for grading, profiling, or employability prediction are **explicitly excluded**

### Activity 1 & 2: AI Tool Compliance & Bias Check

**Activity 1: AI Tool Compliance Checklist**

<br>

**Method:** Guided evaluation in small groups

**Tool Vetting Checklist:**

- [x] Data anonymization possible
- [x] No personal or company-sensitive data required
- [x] Not used for summative grading
- [x] Institutionally approved / pilot-tested
- [x] Accessible language and age-appropriate ToS

> **Teacher-in-the-loop emphasis:** AI is introduced as *assistive*, never authoritative.

<br>

<br>

**Activity 2: Bias & Risk Simulation**

**Test the following:**

1. Speech recognition with **diverse accents**
2. AI-generated vocational vocabulary for **gender or cultural bias**
3. Translation accuracy of **technical terms**

    *"Where could this tool misrepresent my learners or their profession choose multiple?"*

- [x] Assessment and Evaluation
- [x] Reflection
- [ ] Media-usage 

## Phase 2: Pedagogical Design

> **Focus:** Teacher Role & Meaningful AI Integration (90 minutes)

Learning Outcomes

<br>

Teachers will be able to:

- [x] Design AI-supported lessons with **clear pedagogical purpose**
- [x] Maintain **teacher authority over decisions and assessment**
- [x] Integrate AI into **student-centred vocational English strategies**

<br>

Core Pedagogical Principle

> **AI supports learning – it does not replace teaching.**

### Activity 3: AI Use vs Non-Use Comparison

Compare two lesson versions:

* Traditional vocational English activity
* AI-enhanced version

<br>

**Identify:**

1. What **problem AI solves**
2. What **remains human-led**
3. What **must not be automated**

<br>

Example Comparison

| Task | AI Role | Teacher Role |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Writing a safety report | Draft language suggestions | Accuracy, tone, vocational validity |
| Customer dialogue | Role-play simulation | Pragmatics, cultural appropriateness |

### Activity 4: Differentiation with AI

**Practice:**

* Adjusting AI output for **different CEFR levels**
* Using AI to generate **simplified vs technical explanations**
* Designing **choice-based tasks** using AI support

## Phase 3: Student Competency Development

> **Focus:** UNESCO Student Framework – Apply Level (90 minutes)

Learning Outcomes

<br>

Teachers will be able to:

- [x] Design **authentic vocational English tasks** using AI
- [x] Teach students **critical evaluation of AI outputs**
- [x] Reinforce **human agency and responsibility**

<br>

Model Student Task (Demonstration)

**Task Example:** *Simulated International Client Email (Hospitality / Engineering / Healthcare)*

Student Workflow

1. **Draft** email with AI assistance
2. **Critically review:** Technical accuracy, Politeness & intercultural tone, Industry appropriateness
3. **Edit** and finalize manually
4. **Submit** with AI-use declaration

<br>

Teacher Focus Areas

- [x] Students correct AI mistakes
- [x] Students justify language choices
- [x] Students own final output

> **Key Teaching Point:** "AI suggests. Humans decide."

### Data Privacy Micro-Lesson

**Model for students:**

* Safe prompt writing
* Avoiding proprietary data
* Using fictionalized workplace scenarios

<br>

<br>

Environmental Awareness

**2-3 minute awareness segment:**

<br>

What kind of teacher strategy can be designed for this? Let's discuss together this time

    [( )] Assessment
    [( )] Alignment
    [( )] Media-usage
    [(X)] Intervention

<br>

##  Accessibility & Inclusion Planning

**Identify:**

* Voice-to-text options
* Screen-reader compatibility
* Non-AI alternatives for each task

## Phase 5: Assessment & Feedback

* Important! 

<br>

This is not the assessment segment of our workshop, but a teaching phase where teachers are trained for AI usage on student evaluation.

> **Focus:** Process-Oriented, Transparent, Ethical Assessment (60 minutes)

Learning Outcomes

Teachers will be able to:

- [x] Assess **learning processes**, not just outputs
- [x] Define clear AI authorship rules
- [x] Collect feedback on AI effectiveness and bias

<br>

<br>

### Assessment Design Workshop

<br>

**Recommended Assessment Components:**

1. Draft + revision comparison
2. Prompt explanation
3. Oral defence / reflection
4. AI-use declaration statement

<br>

Sample AI Attribution Statement

**Student-Facing:**

```
"AI tools were used to generate an initial draft.
All revisions, corrections, and final decisions were made by me."
```

<br>

<br>

Feedback Loop Design

**Create:**

* Student feedback form on AI usefulness
* Bias/error reporting mechanism
* Teacher reflection log for tool review

## Final Outputs for Teachers

By the end of the training, teachers will have:

- [x] A vetted AI tool shortlist
- [x] A compliant AI-use checklist
- [x] A ready-to-teach AI-enhanced Vocational English lesson
- [x] Ethical & assessment guidelines
- [x] Confidence to justify AI use to stakeholders

<br>

<br>

## Resources & Next Steps

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Review institutional AI policies
2. Pilot one AI-enhanced lesson
3. Join teacher peer-learning community
4. Schedule follow-up reflection session

> **Remember:** The goal is not to become AI experts, but to become better teachers with AI as a supportive tool.
